# Vector Operations

This project is a simple web-based application built with  HTML, CSS  and Jvascript that demonstrates basic algorithmuc problems with vectors and sets
## Features
### Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements
- Takex two sets o numbers (arrays)
- -Finds the elements thta appear in only one of the sets
- -Displays the distinct elements and their sum
- Example
- Set 1: `[3, 1 ,7, 9]`
- Set 2: `[2 ,4 ,1 ,9, 3]`
- Distinct elements: `[7,2,4[`
- Sum: `13`

#Problem 2: Dot product & Orthogonality
-Takes tow vectors o equal lentgth.
-Computes the dot produc
-Checks whether the vectors are orthogonal (dot product=0
Example
V1: `[1 ,2 3]`
v2: `[-3, 6, -3]
Dot prodcut: 3;
Orthogonal: 'No'
